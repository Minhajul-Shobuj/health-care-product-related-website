            <p>A clinician is a health worker who works directly with patients in a hospital or other healthcare setting. Nurses, doctors, psychotherapists, and other specialists are all clinicians.

                Not all medical specialists are clinicians. Researchers and laboratory workers are not clinicians because they do not work with patients.

                The physician assesses the individual, with the aim of diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease using knowledge learned from training, research, and experiences, and clinical judgment.</p>
            <h1>Biomedical research</h1>
            <p>This area of science seeks ways to prevent and treat diseases that lead to illness or death.

                Biomedical scientists use biotechnology techniques to study biological processes and diseases. They aim to develop successful treatments and cures.

                Biomedical research requires careful experimentation, development, and evaluation. It involves biologists, chemists, doctors, pharmacologists, and others.</p>
            <h1>Medications</h1>
            <p>This field looks at drugs or medicines and how to use them.

                Doctors and other health professionals use medications in the medical diagnosis, treatment, cure, and prevention of disease.</p>
            <h1>Surgery</h1>
            <p>Surgical procedures are necessary for diagnosing and treating some types of disease, malfomation, and injury. They use instrumental and manual means rather than medication.

                A surgeon may carry out a surgical procedure to remove or replace diseased tissue or organs, or they may use surgery to remove tissue for biopsy. Sometimes, they remove unwanted tissue and then send it for diagnosis.</p>
            <h1>Medical devices</h1>
            <p>Health professionals use a wide range of instruments to diagnose and treat a disease or other condition, to prevent a worsening of symptoms, to replace a damaged part — such as a hip or a knee — and so on.

                Medical devices range from test tubes to sophisticated scanning machines.</p>
